# AutoFix Garage — FormSubmit Edition

This version wires the booking form directly to your email using **FormSubmit** (free, no signup required).

## Quick Setup
1. Open `index.html` and replace `YOUR_EMAIL@gmail.com` with your real email address.
2. (Optional) After you deploy on GitHub Pages, update the hidden `_next` field to your full URL, e.g.
   `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/car-mechanic-website/thank-you.html`
3. Push to GitHub → Settings → Pages → enable.

## Notes
- On the first submission, FormSubmit will email you to confirm your address (one-time).  
- After confirmation, all future bookings arrive instantly in your inbox in a table format.
